1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
They were going to do
a couple of things.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,580
First, we're a wrap up
from Wednesday's lecture.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,360
So we looked at three
of the big resources.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,359
We looked at tribute,
Babary storage.

5
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,839
We didn't have a
chance to talk at all

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:11,939
about networking, so we'll
do a little bit of that.

7
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:15,279
I have a recording up
from Wednesday as well.

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,579
So if you missed for

9
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:18,319
su reason or you just
got into the course,

10
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,240
that would be a good
thing to review.

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,299
There are more Anki
flashcards coming.

12
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,320
How many people have
already installed Anki

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,794
and spent at least some
time studying on it.

14
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,329
So just a couple of you.

15
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,010
I think that's really a
good way to get ahead.

16
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,049
What I've seen is that some
people will try to, like,

17
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:35,209
save them up, and then they try

18
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,709
to cram for the
mid term with it.

19
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:39,349
I think that actually you
end up spending more time

20
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:40,829
overall more time of

21
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,849
your life if you try
to do it all at once,

22
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:44,449
like a little bit here and there

23
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:47,130
can really help you
remember things.

24
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,509
I think now is the easiest
time in the semester

25
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:52,790
to make a habit of doing
that. You're not as busy.

26
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,449
And if you start a few weeks in,

27
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,149
well, you have 30 here,

28
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,310
30 here, and all of a
sudden starts feeling

29
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,150
a little bit daunting
to get started.

30
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,509
So I'd strongly encourage
you to just get started now.

31
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:05,250
That'll give you kind of
an edge in the course.

32
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,510
If you do end up starting later,

33
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,510
there's ways to configure it,

34
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,090
so we'll show you
at, like, most,

35
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,209
say, like 20 new
flash cards a day.

36
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,410
So do something like that.

37
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,010
So whatever it takes to make it,

38
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,750
something that's
not intimidating

39
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,110
and something you actually
want to spend time on.

40
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,734
Alright, cool. So I have a
worksheet for today as well.

41
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:24,460
You know, I used to
print these, but then,

42
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,779
like, a lot of
people have tablets,

43
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:27,360
and you know, there's
always some people who are

44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,200
sick or or don't make
it for whatever reason.

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,080
So anyway, I'll leave
these to you all to print.

46
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,160
I'll just send a reminder
when there's one to print.

47
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,479
This one is kind
of a simple one.

48
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,379
It's just a bunch of
terms to remember.

49
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:38,320
And what I'd like
you to do is as

50
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,260
I'm showing you a bunch
of Linux commands today,

51
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,159
I want you to just write
down in your own words,

52
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,659
what each of these does.

53
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:45,119
And then you can
check back across

54
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,619
this list later to
see if you miss any.

55
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:48,700
And we'll actually spend

56
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,550
a couple of lectures
to get through this.

57
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,479
Alright, I'm going to
head back over here,

58
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,280
and we will look at the slides
where we were last time.

59
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,539
And we're going to talk a
little bit about networking.

60
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:01,220
And networking is really key to

61
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,020
this idea of scaling out
instead of scaling up.

62
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,160
Right? If I have a bunch
of different computers

63
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,940
that are working together
to solve a problem,

64
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,179
they have to
communicate and that

65
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,015
communication happens
over a network.

66
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:15,530
Let's see how that might look
in a typical data center.

67
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,530
So when you're buying a server,

68
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,909
it'll often look a bit
different than say, like,

69
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,610
a laptop or maybe a deskop
computer you might buy.

70
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,010
They're just trying
to make it compact

71
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,889
in a nice boxy shape like this.

72
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:28,829
So here's an example of a
common server you might see.

73
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,069
And you can stack all
of these on top of

74
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,469
each other in something
called a RAC, right?

75
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:34,990
So I have a rack
up servers there.

76
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,909
On the bottom, I have
some power supply,

77
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:40,530
and also Um, there's
some network switches,

78
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,429
so all of these can
communicate with each other?

79
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,169
They're attached
to each other via

80
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:45,510
those either net tables.

81
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,510
If I have a lot of
computer resources,

82
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,069
I could have a whole data
center of these, right?

83
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:52,970
Racks upon racks on racks.

84
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,229
Now, if I have two
machines in the same rack,

85
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:56,989
they're directly connected
that same switch,

86
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:58,790
and they can communicate
pretty fast.

87
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,830
And so sometimes people
will try to colocate

88
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,350
two applications
that are working

89
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,229
together in the same place.

90
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:07,269
Can anybody think of a reason

91
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:08,649
why you might not
want to do that,

92
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:17,490
even though it's faster?
Yeah, right here.

93
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,209
Excellent, right? If the
switch goes down and I have

94
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,830
maybe two copies of my data

95
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,350
or something in the same Iraq,

96
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,750
then I would lose it altogether.

97
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,489
So Iraq is what we might
call a fault domain, right?

98
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:33,469
It's kind of a case
where, like, one problem

99
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:36,724
could take down multiple
instances, right?

100
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:38,620
Looking a little
bit more broadly.

101
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,780
I mean, there could be a tornado

102
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,159
or an earthquake or
something like that,

103
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,879
but we could lose the
whole data center,

104
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,520
there could be a
local power outage.

105
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,459
And so that's also
a fault domain.

106
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,759
You could start imagining having

107
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,799
different data centers and

108
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,160
maybe even different countries.

109
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,519
And so we're going
to be talking about

110
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,340
that in the middle
part of the semester.

111
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,479
We're going to be worried a lot

112
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,119
about how we can
be fault tolerant.

113
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,239
When something
like that happens,

114
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,420
how can we make sure
that we don't lose

115
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,179
data or we don't
lose availability?

116
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:03,340
So for example,
were going to learn

117
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,740
about the Hadu file system,

118
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,919
and in the Hadu file system,
you can configure it,

119
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,339
and you can tell it about
your network topology.

120
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:11,939
Network topology refers to
kind of the structure of which

121
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,299
computers are connected to each

122
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:14,920
other directly or less directly.

123
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,339
And so you can see with
the Hadu file system,

124
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,340
you kind of specify that,

125
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,860
and it might take some steps
to make sure you don't have

126
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,360
all the copies of your data

127
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,880
in the same rack or
something like that.

128
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,120
Some of the metrics that we
have with networking are

129
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,399
actually pretty similar to
what we saw for a disc.

130
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,980
So latency Latency is

131
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,080
just a general measure of
how long something takes.

132
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,419
And so there might be different

133
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:38,720
latency measures people have.

134
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,580
Maybe people just
have a question of

135
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,560
how long it takes to get
from point A to point B.

136
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,459
People might talk about
round trip latency,

137
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,619
how long it takes to send

138
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,800
a message to the server and
actually get a response back.

139
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,360
But ultimately, it's some
measure of elapsed time.

140
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,590
We can also measure performance
in terms of a rate.

141
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,990
So people might talk
about bandwidth.

142
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,869
Bandwidth would be kind of
a theoretical maximum bytes

143
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,009
per second that we might be able

144
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,229
to send over our hardware.

145
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:05,910
Throughput is also a rate.

146
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,330
Maybe more often used.

147
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,729
It's the same idea,
it's more often

148
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,310
used to refer to what
the application is

149
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,950
actually doing instead of

150
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,109
perhaps the hardware
capabilities.

151
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:15,889
And with disks,

152
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,810
that's usually measured
in bytes per second,

153
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,150
for whatever reason, when

154
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,689
we're talking about
net networks,

155
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,809
it's more common to talk
about bits per second.

156
00:05:22,809 --> 00:05:24,790
And so people might
say things like this.

157
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,650
They might say BPS.

158
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,930
And the fact that the B is

159
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,029
lower case means it's
bits per second,

160
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,950
and that would be in contrast
with MB over S, right?

161
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,409
So 10 megabits per
second is in bits.

162
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:41,370
10 megabytes/second would
be 88 times faster.

163
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,990
Often, if things
are lower latency,

164
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,669
I might also have higher

165
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:48,249
bandwidth, but that's
not always true.

166
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:50,070
You can imagine a scenario
where this computer in

167
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,989
the middle is talking
with two other computers.

168
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:53,230
And on the one hand side,

169
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,149
I have a computer that's kind
of geographically nearby,

170
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,210
but maybe my switch doesn't
have much bandwidth, right?

171
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,890
So maybe I can, you know,

172
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,369
send a packet to an
response very quickly,

173
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:06,870
but I can't send a lot of
data at the same time.

174
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,929
In contrast, maybe this computer

175
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:10,850
is somewhere else on the
other side of the Internet,

176
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,190
and it might take
a long time for

177
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,710
messages to go back and forth,

178
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,824
but maybe I have a higher
capacity on my connection.

179
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,980
So I just wanted to do
a quick top at to make

180
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,759
sure people are still
good on these units.

181
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm going to pop over
here and start that.

182
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,539
And so a computer can
download eight B MB pS.

183
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,019
What is that in BPS?

184
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,289
A 20 seconds left.

185
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,310
Alright, fantastic.
Most people are

186
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,290
saying 64 megabits per second.

187
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,869
Right? There's eight
bits per byte.

188
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:56,969
So if I'm going from a byte
based unit to bit based unit,

189
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:58,770
I'd have to multiply by eight.

190
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,009
All right. Cool. So
that's networking.

191
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,049
Let's talk a little
bit about deployment.

192
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:06,010
Deployment means
actually figuring out

193
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,009
how to go and run
your code somewhere.

194
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:09,189
That's often quite challenging,

195
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,949
especially if you have
kind of a large cluster,

196
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,410
and you have to get your
software running out

197
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,949
all the different
workers in the cluster.

198
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:16,709
This semester, we're at

199
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,130
least for the first
half of the semester,

200
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,529
we'll deploy on Google's Cloud,

201
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:22,790
which is called GCP
Google Cloud Platform.

202
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,369
And basically what all
these cloud providers

203
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:26,649
are doing is they're
buying large,

204
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:29,850
powerful physical machines
that are in a data center,

205
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,630
kind of like in that
picture I showed you,

206
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,949
and then they're running
virtual machines on top of it.

207
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,369
And so a virtual machine,

208
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:39,170
it really kind of feels
like a physical machine.

209
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,589
You can interact with it
in a lot of the same ways.

210
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,429
But it's only using a fraction

211
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,130
of the resources of
that physical machine.

212
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,329
So they might actually pack
on a lot of virtual machines,

213
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:48,769
and they will rent that to you,

214
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,429
of course, with some
kind of mark up.

215
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,429
I put rented in quotes
because you're going to get

216
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:53,629
some free Google credits that

217
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:55,490
you'll use for that
this semester.

218
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,590
Your VMs are going to be
running Ubuntu Linux 2404.

219
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,090
So that's their most recent

220
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,190
long term support
support version.

221
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,079
So I've shared some
details about that.

222
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,280
This link here shows you
how to get those resources.

223
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,479
We need to make sure we
don't run out of credits,

224
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,499
otherwise you have to start
paying out of out of pocket.

225
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:17,500
And if you follow all the
directions carefully,

226
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,020
you will not find yourself
in that situation.

227
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,479
And so what we're
going to be using is

228
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:25,120
E two small instances
with 25 gigabyte disks.

229
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,739
And basically what I've done is

230
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:28,459
I've entered the
daily cost here,

231
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,739
and I show the cumulative
how much you should be

232
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:33,240
spending of your free
credits by a given date.

233
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,620
So for example, on October 15,

234
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,650
check in and make sure you've
not spent more than $20 Um,

235
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,810
this is what is going to happen.

236
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,329
Unless you somehow
misconfigured.

237
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:42,450
If you have multiple VMs

238
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,729
at the same time or
something like that,

239
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:45,690
you might burn
through that faster.

240
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,870
I guess you could
end up spending

241
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,250
a little bit of money depending

242
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,350
on whether that matters to you.

243
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,330
But one way to catch up
would be just be turning off

244
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,529
the virtual machine
when you're not

245
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,170
using it, say, like overnight.

246
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,849
I somehow you make
a mistake and you

247
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:58,470
need to catch up on the budget,

248
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,090
so you can save yourself
a bit of money there.

249
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,290
We'll see what happens
after October 15.

250
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,529
I think the department's getting

251
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:04,870
some new servers that will

252
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,349
probably use for a
portion of the course.

253
00:10:06,349 --> 00:10:08,490
So I'll kind of
fill this in based

254
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,849
on when those servers
are ready for us to use.

255
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:12,330
But we might get
some more resources

256
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,109
than we've had in
previous semesters,

257
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:18,689
which would be pretty
exciting. So check up on that.

258
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:20,769
And there's a few
responsibilities that

259
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:22,950
you're going to have
with regard to your VM,

260
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,149
the semester, you have to
go create it yourself,

261
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:26,269
and if somehow gets

262
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:27,789
messed up you're going
to have to recreate it.

263
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:29,609
You have to figure out what
region you want it in.

264
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:32,229
I choose Iowa because
it's close to us,

265
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:34,009
right, so it's going
to be lower latency.

266
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,930
You have to figure out how
to connect it with SSH.

267
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,709
I'll show an example
of that, but you're

268
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:38,489
going to have to
kind of get that

269
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:39,490
set up on your computer.

270
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,389
You're going to have to install

271
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,369
some software on your
virtual machines.

272
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:44,010
As we talk about
like, we just give

273
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,449
you like a strip that
does all that for you,

274
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:47,570
but I think it's actually
valuable to learn how to

275
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,289
set things up yourself so
that after the semester,

276
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:52,179
if you have some project
idea, you can go

277
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,589
Do stuff, even if you don't

278
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:54,710
have the supportive
office hours.

279
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,409
So we're trying to making
you do some extra work,

280
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:58,769
but I do think it has
pedagogical value.

281
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,830
You might have to
reboot after updates.

282
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,269
Make sure you back up your work.

283
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:03,849
You know, occasionally,
people's VMs get

284
00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:06,310
messed up and they
might lose work there.

285
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,509
You know, you could
do that by pushing to

286
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:11,049
a private repository
on ditab or GitHub,

287
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:13,630
or I'm going to teach
a tool SCP today that

288
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,269
you could use to download
stuff off of your laptop.

289
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:18,530
And then you have to
resolve any issues

290
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,709
directly with Google
if they show up.

291
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:22,629
By far, the most common issue

292
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:25,030
is that they think
people are cryptomining,

293
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,249
and I'll believe
my students that

294
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:27,944
always tell me they
weren't cryptomining.

295
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:28,580
Basically,

296
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,379
Google is worried that they
give you free credits,

297
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,079
and then you basically
turn those credits into

298
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,400
money by min mining
crypto, right?

299
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,339
That's against their policies,
and they try to detect,

300
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:38,439
based on your CPU
usage or whatever,

301
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,019
if you're doing
something like that,

302
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,379
and then they'll
sometimes flag you

303
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:42,839
and they'll, block
your account for Wb.

304
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,140
H is like, Oh, you're
a crypto mining,

305
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,419
and you just submit
a form saying,

306
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:46,659
I'm very sorry I
wasn't doing that,

307
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:47,940
and they're like,
Okay, ok, fine.

308
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,980
You can have another chance.

309
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,360
Anyway, I tried to interject
myself in that process,

310
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,780
and I mean, they're a business,

311
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,859
and they're like, Oh,
you're not the customer.

312
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:56,859
We will not talk to you.
They're not really set

313
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:57,739
up to think about while

314
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:58,999
there's an instructor
and students.

315
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:00,220
So anyway, You know,

316
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,419
you'll have to
interact directly with

317
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:02,999
Google if that happens
because they don't

318
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,240
want me as an instructor

319
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,959
in the middle, but it's
always been sorted out.

320
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,299
If you just kind of
follow up with them.

321
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:08,760
Do it quickly, right
because there might be

322
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,259
some delay to them
getting back to you.

323
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,970
We're also going to be in
addition to virtual machines,

324
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,270
we're to be using containers,

325
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,349
this semester and particular
docker containers.

326
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:21,210
We'll talk more about what
containers are, but for now,

327
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,370
we can think of it
as a lightweight

328
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,010
alternative to virtual machines.

329
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,629
And so on your one and
only virtual machine,

330
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:27,750
you'll have this semester.

331
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,949
You can have a bunch of
different docker containers.

332
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:32,909
And by doing that,
they're going to have

333
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:35,350
kind of like a virtual
container network.

334
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,889
And so it'll feel like you have

335
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,950
a small little cluster of

336
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,869
systems that are interoperating
with each other.

337
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:43,489
And you're going to be alone the

338
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:45,339
same skills you would
directly apply.

339
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,469
Someday when you actually
have a real cluster of

340
00:12:47,469 --> 00:12:48,730
machines available
to you and you're

341
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,949
deploying these systems on them.

342
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:52,010
So everybody will have
these many clusters

343
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,740
running on top of their
own virtual machines.

344
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,549
A quick conclusion, right?

345
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:59,209
Systems, manage resources,
whether you're writing

346
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,389
analysis code or
building applications.

347
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,550
You're going to
be using systems.

348
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,449
Maybe you're even making
new systems yourselves.

349
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:06,769
So this is stuff
we have to learn.

350
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,009
And these systems manage
resources, right?

351
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:10,870
Like compute memory
storage network.

352
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,449
We want to figure out how to
use systems in a way that we

353
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:16,350
use those efficient
resources efficiently.

354
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,549
We're learning about big
data systems a semester,

355
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,110
and that means we're
going to be specifically

356
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,469
looking at cases where we need

357
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,270
either specialized
hardware or more

358
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,990
typically just a
cluster of machines.

359
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,129
So I'm going to head over.

360
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:29,609
We're actually going to
jump in and start doing

361
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,270
some examples on the
virtual machine,

362
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,949
and I've sent direction
so people can

363
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:34,954
start setting that up
if you would like.

364
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:39,459
M. Yeah um, so how can we
deploy things on Linux?

365
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:41,100
I have a few things I
want you to learn today.

366
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,339
I want you to navigate

367
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:44,000
your way around a
Linux file system,

368
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,520
operate in a Linux shell.

369
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,860
I want you to learn how to
automate repetitive tasks.

370
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,300
You can imagine if
you have to deploy

371
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,700
the same thing on 100 machines.

372
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,239
Wow, that's very important.

373
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,559
Where I learn how we can chain

374
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,840
multiple Linux programs together

375
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,760
to accomplish more
complicated things.

376
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,220
And finally, how can we capture

377
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,380
the output of a
process in a file?

378
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,480
In this kind of environment
that's hugely important,

379
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,699
maybe most of you
are used to kind of,

380
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,560
like running programs and
directly seeing the output.

381
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,379
If there's a bunch of
things running at once,

382
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:10,559
it kind of makes more sense to

383
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,119
put that output to
different files.

384
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,219
And so we're kind of
redirecting output to files and

385
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,799
then checking up on what
those files contain.

386
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,219
Okay, so to do all
this, you have to get

387
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:22,040
extremely comfortable with
a program called the shell.

388
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,539
You all have used shells before.

389
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:25,259
But let's just think a
little bit more deeply

390
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,179
about what a shell is
and what it's doing.

391
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:28,680
If I was write pseudocode for

392
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,179
a shell, it might look
something like this.

393
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:32,379
It's just a big loop that prints

394
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:35,179
a prompt and the prompt means,
tell me something to do.

395
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:38,699
It takes some input
from the keyboard,

396
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:41,299
and that input is the
name of some command,

397
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:42,500
and then it will
run that command.

398
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,020
And it's really a
super helpful program

399
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,239
because it's just
constantly asking,

400
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:47,019
what can I do for you,
and then it does it,

401
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,819
right, so you can kind
of type those things in.

402
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:50,700
So there's no graphical
user interface.

403
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,430
We're just doing everything
based on typing.

404
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,899
One of the reasons this is
really powerful is that if

405
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:58,040
you figure out how to do
it manually via typing,

406
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,479
then you can put
all those commands

407
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,180
in a text file with
some extension,

408
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,020
maybe SH or whatever,
it doesn't matter.

409
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,999
And you can feed
all those commands

410
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:06,820
from that text file
into the shell,

411
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,519
and it will automatically
do all those steps for you.

412
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,739
How many of you have ever

413
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:12,459
automated something where
you kind of have to, like,

414
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:13,959
click buttons or actually, like,

415
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,359
manipulate a real browser
or anything like that.

416
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:19,769
So a few of you, was that,
like, a fun thing to do?

417
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,979
So if some people are
nodding their heads,

418
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:23,239
yes, I hate doing that, right?

419
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:24,540
It's kind of finicky,

420
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,760
and I kind of get it working,

421
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,760
and then, you know,
buttons change position,

422
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,000
and it doesn't work anymore.

423
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,640
So this will be much more robust

424
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,139
and faster than trying to

425
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:36,084
automate something with a
graphical user interface.

426
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:39,869
So a shell can let
you run programs,

427
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:42,390
and a shell is itself a program.

428
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,589
And so maybe you can infer
from that that you can

429
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,710
actually use a shell
to run other shells.

430
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,290
And I'm actually doing that
here. I have a bash shell.

431
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,629
I'm typing some stuff in it.

432
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:54,869
That's fine and well, and then
putting what directory in.

433
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:56,330
And then I run ZSH.

434
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,369
That's the Z shell, and
I'll start running that,

435
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:00,459
and I could start running
commands and that

436
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,030
The most common situation

437
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,930
where you're going to be running

438
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,470
a shell inside of a
shell is with SSH,

439
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,910
which is the secure shell.

440
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,229
And SSH is a special
shell because

441
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:12,109
it lets me type my
commands on one computer,

442
00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:14,470
but then they execute on
a different computer,

443
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,789
say that virtual machine

444
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:17,389
that I'm running in
the Cloud, right?

445
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:19,850
So here I type SSH.

446
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,969
And then down here, I run
some more commands and

447
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:24,190
those commands are
running in the Cloud.

448
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,390
So that's extremely powerful.

449
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,989
And you're going to be doing
you're going to be living in

450
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:31,630
SSH this whole course this
semester. Alright, cool.

451
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,184
So I'm I jump over, I'm
going to do some examples.

452
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:36,500
Just trying to help everybody
get on the same page.

453
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,579
I know some people who have
used virtual machines before,

454
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:39,840
maybe even on Google Cloud.

455
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,080
So my apologies if some
of this is repetitive,

456
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,179
but I just want to
make sure we're

457
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:45,539
all coming at it with
the same background.

458
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:50,280
So right here, I am signed
into the Google Cloud Console.

459
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,699
And what I want to go to is

460
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:55,320
their Compute engine because
under Compute Engine,

461
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,225
they have a virtual machine.

462
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,109
Instances, and I have a few.

463
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:00,310
If you have a few that's
probably actually

464
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,650
a problem you're going to
burn through your credit,

465
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,970
but I was just try
messing around.

466
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,170
I only have one really
running right now.

467
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,710
And you can see this
one's up and running.

468
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,389
And I can see that it has
an external IP address.

469
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:11,849
I'm going to click on
this to copy that.

470
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,950
We may be talking
more about networking

471
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,809
and IP addresses
pretty soon, actually.

472
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:19,170
But what I can do now is
I can use a secure shell,

473
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,090
and I can say my user name at,

474
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,050
and then I can paste
that IP address

475
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,969
and try to get access to it.

476
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:26,410
So, okay, great.

477
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,550
What is my user name?

478
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,510
So I'm mana come
over here and I'm

479
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,259
going to go down to metadata.

480
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,739
And under metadata, I have
these things called SSH keys.

481
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:37,379
And I actually see
I have two of them.

482
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:38,359
You'll just have one,

483
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,919
and you're going to have
to create it yourself.

484
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,460
And I'm going to
use this one TRH.

485
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,159
I'm going to put that SSH,

486
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:49,399
my user name, and then that
IP address. You to run that.

487
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:51,519
And now I'm inside of
my virtual machine,

488
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,079
and I can run commands here.

489
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:56,759
So how did this SSH
stuff get set up?

490
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:00,700
Well, I created what is
called an SSH key pair.

491
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,940
The way I did that
is I came over here,

492
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,440
and I ran this program
called SSH key gen,

493
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,500
and it kind of walked me through

494
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,400
this step a few steps you
can kind of go through.

495
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,339
I'm not trying to
do it right now

496
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:12,400
because I already did it before.

497
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,399
I actually hit Control C.
Control C doesn't copy things,

498
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,480
that actually kills
what I was doing.

499
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,839
Anyway, that will generate
a key payer for me,

500
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,679
and it's showing
me right here that

501
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,099
this is where one
of my keys will be.

502
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:26,119
So let me just take
a look at this.

503
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,589
And This one that it

504
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:31,130
generated is what we
call a private key.

505
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,370
And a private key is really

506
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,110
an alternative to
like a password.

507
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,829
That's what how I show
that I am, who I say I am.

508
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:39,169
So I'm not going
to show you that

509
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:40,670
right now because that
would be terrible.

510
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,590
All of you could do all
kinds of horrible things.

511
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,489
What I will show you is what is

512
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:46,630
associated with
that private key,

513
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,690
and that's the public key.

514
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,740
So here's a public
key right here.

515
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,050
So these two things
come in a pair,

516
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,769
and I think the private
key, it works like

517
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:55,649
an actual key based on
your intuition, right?

518
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:57,489
I kind of open
things up for you.

519
00:18:57,489 --> 00:18:59,110
I think the public key,

520
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,389
maybe it's more intuitively
like a lock, right?

521
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:05,010
We can put the public if you
install a lock on something,

522
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,649
you have the key for it,
and you can open it.

523
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:08,470
So things you might
do is you might put

524
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,850
your public key on Git Hub,

525
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,289
and then it'll
give you access to

526
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:14,089
if you have the
corresponding private key.

527
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:18,709
I might put my public
key on the Google Cloud,

528
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:19,969
and then I can get access to

529
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:21,269
those VMs because I have

530
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:22,909
the associated
private key, right?

531
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:24,729
It's try to I'm comfortable

532
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:25,569
showing you my public he

533
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:26,709
is there's not much
you can do it.

534
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:29,070
You can just give me access
to stuff, and if you do, why?

535
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,649
Thank you very much. So what

536
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:33,089
I could do is I could copy this.

537
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,470
And I've already done this.
I'm not going to do it again.

538
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,209
But under this
metadata SSH stuff,

539
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:41,569
what I had done before
is I pasted it in,

540
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:43,670
and that's how I was able
to get that set off.

541
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,390
And you can actually see
that I had done it twice.

542
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,069
I actually have two
different users

543
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:49,670
each with a different SSH keys.

544
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,869
You might end up
in that situation

545
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:52,310
if you like switch laptops,

546
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,350
mid semester, I guess I' just
having fun with SSH keys.

547
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,490
I be kind a little bit weird,

548
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,449
great, but whatever
is fun for you.

549
00:19:58,449 --> 00:20:00,549
Cool. So I was able to do that.

550
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:03,009
Because I have that is

551
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:05,589
why I'm able to do
this SSH, right?

552
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:07,829
So when I do this SSH,

553
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,170
let me just do it again.

554
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:10,989
When I'm doing that,

555
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:12,910
it's automatically
finding my private key.

556
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,050
If I had more than one private

557
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,230
key I'm like a more course,

558
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,370
I might have to change it a bit

559
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,690
to tell it which one I'm using.

560
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,010
But because I have
that private key,

561
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,790
I don't need to password
or anything else.

562
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,470
That private key says,

563
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,189
I am who I say I
am, and I'm able to

564
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,129
get get access to
this virtual machine.

565
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:28,489
Right? So if I type up here
it's on my virtual machine,

566
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:30,709
I I hit Control D, Control D

567
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,649
means I'm done typing,
and I drop out of it.

568
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,849
Now I'm back to typing
things on my laptop.

569
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:37,849
You know, I could do
like SSH, TRH each time.

570
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:39,369
That would be
annoying. I can use

571
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:40,929
up and down arrow keys, right?

572
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:42,409
To get to these
different commands.

573
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,100
That's one thing I can do Let

574
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,519
me just do Control
C to kill that.

575
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,759
The other thing that's
going to be a big

576
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,299
time saver is Control R.

577
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,720
If I do Control R, I can
do a reverse search,

578
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,160
and I start typing SSH,

579
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,359
and I jump back to that
previous command, right?

580
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,799
So it's really important.

581
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:56,579
If you get dread at

582
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:57,999
all these commands,
you memorize them,

583
00:20:57,999 --> 00:20:59,359
you're going to have be able to

584
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,459
complete this course
with spending less time,

585
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,059
and it'll be more enjoyable.

586
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,299
So get dread at these commands.
It's really important.

587
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:09,099
Alright. Fantastic. So now
I am on my virtual machine.

588
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:10,480
Maybe I just pause
there because maybe

589
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,979
some of that is
new to some folks.

590
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,779
People have any
questions about my BM

591
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,779
or my SSH keys or any of that.

592
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,719
Yeah, right here.

593
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,959
Cloud.

594
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:29,459
Are we supposed to be at
this at this point or Yeah,

595
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:33,399
I think that I didn't add
anybody to anything, right?

596
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:38,639
I think that if I come back
here or where it was it.

597
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:43,859
So I updated all the
links to on Project one,

598
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:45,499
if you just start
doing Project one,

599
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:48,059
it will tell you how to get
access to the stuff, right?

600
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,759
So you'll have to go to

601
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:50,839
this Canvas page and that will

602
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,139
tell you how to get
like the free credits,

603
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:53,399
and you have to create
an account with that.

604
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,199
So I don't know if you've had
a chance to look at that.

605
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,859
So drove through that and
if you get stuck on that,

606
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,740
you know just show somebody
in person like during

607
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,899
office hours or after lecture

608
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:01,539
and we'll make sure
everybody gets on.

609
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:03,399
Yeah, Thank you.
Yeah, other questions

610
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:07,459
people have. All right.

611
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,919
Cool. So I'm on my
virtual machine,

612
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,059
and I can start running stuff.

613
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:12,979
One of the first
things I do is PWD.

614
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:15,820
That shows me the
working directory.

615
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,299
So one of the things
you're ready notice is

616
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:19,279
that I'm not trying to
use the word folder,

617
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,479
I'm going to use
the word directory.

618
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,719
They mean the same thing, but

619
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,319
directory is the
more technical term,

620
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:26,079
and all the acronyms have D
in them for directory, right?

621
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,839
So if you remember
directory, you remember the.

622
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,060
So print working directory,

623
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,979
that means that this is

624
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:32,079
the location I'm
currently in right now.

625
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,499
It's one of the first
commands I run when I jump on

626
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:37,220
a on a new environment.

627
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,219
The other thing I
often run is I run LS.

628
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:41,560
LS is short for list,

629
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,719
but it shows me what
files are there.

630
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:45,519
You already notice
that Linux commands

631
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,124
are notoriously turf.

632
00:22:47,124 --> 00:22:48,910
That means they're going
to be harder to learn,

633
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,849
but once you learn them

634
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:51,389
you're going to be a
lot faster, right?

635
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:53,929
I don't know how many
hundreds of thousands

636
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:55,009
of times I've typed LS,

637
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,530
but probably adds up that I've

638
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,309
been typing two characters
instead of four.

639
00:22:58,309 --> 00:22:59,869
So spend time, get rid of these,

640
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:02,729
and then it's going to save
you time in the long run.

641
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,909
Let's talk about files.

642
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:06,649
Let's create some files on here.

643
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:08,050
One way I can create a file

644
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,349
is with the Touch
command, right?

645
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:11,970
So if I touch example dot TXT,

646
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,029
and then do LS, I see
all of a sudden I

647
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:17,140
have an empty file there
called example dot TXT.

648
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,729
I probably want to edit

649
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:20,269
it and write something
inside of it.

650
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:21,730
So I need some kind of editor.

651
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,830
Now, in an intra level
course, I would tell you, Oh,

652
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,610
use exactly this editor,

653
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,409
whatever it is I
want you to use.

654
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:28,630
We're in an upper level course.

655
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,269
I think now is a point
where you can kind of,

656
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:31,509
like, explore different editors,

657
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,630
figure out what you
like, find one tool,

658
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,489
get really good at it, right?

659
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:38,129
And so I'm just trying to
quick show you a few options,

660
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:39,210
and you can talk
with your friends,

661
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,234
see what they're using,
do a little research.

662
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:44,359
One of the simplest
command line editors.

663
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,119
I'm kind of interesting in

664
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,460
command line editors
because I'm inside

665
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,859
of SSH right now is Nano.

666
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,259
And so I could do NO this,

667
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,479
and I could say, hello, world.

668
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,879
Why is Nano so simple?

669
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,219
Well, all the
commands you need to

670
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:57,319
know are right down here
on the bottom, right?

671
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,259
So that little arrow
means control.

672
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:01,919
And so if I say control X,

673
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,239
I know that's going to it

674
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:04,719
for me, right? I can do control.

675
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:08,774
Oh, H. I can do control X.

676
00:24:08,774 --> 00:24:10,969
See how simple it is to use.

677
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:12,369
So Control X, do I want to

678
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,630
say buffer is just
my memory file?

679
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,149
Yes, I want to save it.
That sounds good to me.

680
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:19,809
And then I can see
it's there, right?

681
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,069
Another editor you might use.

682
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:23,389
That's a bit more complicated,

683
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:25,590
but we'll save you
some time is VM.

684
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,749
And so I'm going
to do VM on this,

685
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:29,869
and I can open it up, and I
can see it's the same thing.

686
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,045
Do you have any Vn
users in the room?

687
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:34,979
Yeah, maybe maybe
ten or 15% of you.

688
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:36,479
So I think that's kind of one

689
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,220
of the more popular
command line ones.

690
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,479
I'm not a VM user, but kind of,

691
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,619
like, what is interesting about

692
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:42,979
is it kind of switches
between, like,

693
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:44,800
a typing mode and
a command mode,

694
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,999
and I can hit escape to
kind of toggle those.

695
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:50,200
And so when I'm here
in the command mode,

696
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,679
I can say colon, and
then I could say Q.

697
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,099
And then I could quit out
of that if I wanted to.

698
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:57,039
The one I'm going to be
doing my examples in

699
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,499
because I'm most familiar
with it is EMAC.

700
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:02,779
Any EMAC users in the
room? A few of you.

701
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:05,360
Cool. So I'm going to use E MAC,

702
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,779
and then I can edit this and
change it however I like.

703
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,219
Alright, C, I can do
any of those, right?

704
00:25:14,219 --> 00:25:15,660
So those are all options.

705
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,259
Another thing that's
becoming very

706
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:19,920
popular is visual studio code,

707
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,940
any visual studio
code users here.

708
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,640
That's graphical,
but it would still

709
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,239
it has like an SFH plug in.

710
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,620
So you kind of have
that graphical

711
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,060
experience on your laptop,

712
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,879
but you can edit files remotely.

713
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:33,059
And so you can look
into that if you want.

714
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:37,789
Actually, Under resources, I
have these lecture snippets,

715
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:39,029
where sometimes I
just like paste

716
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:41,709
random stuff that I might
give people access to.

717
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,009
So you can see some
links here for

718
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,029
visual studio code
and the SSH bug in.

719
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:47,549
So feel free to do that
if you like, as well.

720
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:48,929
I think the important
thing is choose

721
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:50,789
one thing and get really
good at it, right?

722
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:54,510
So you can operate quickly
in this environment.

723
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,809
Some of these things
were already installed.

724
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:58,770
This virtual machine
came with an AON VM.

725
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,329
It didn't have emaCs on it when

726
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,309
I did it before, so
I had to install it.

727
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:05,300
So I go back and I'm
going to search for APT.

728
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,649
And look for my command I
use to install that, right?

729
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:12,229
So I have the pseudo
app to install,

730
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:13,929
and then EMAC with

731
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:16,649
no user interface is what
I had to install for that.

732
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:18,329
Let me just get rid of some of

733
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:20,829
these things to show kind
of a simpler version of it.

734
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,109
So APT is what we use to
install software on Ubuntu.

735
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:25,829
And when I run it like that, it

736
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:27,089
doesn't give me access to it.

737
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:29,209
So I can have access to root or

738
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:31,929
what we'd call administrator
privileges if I want to,

739
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:33,169
but I have to say that this

740
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:34,429
is something I want
to use it for.

741
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:36,649
I can kind of help me not use

742
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:39,029
my powers to do something
I'm not very confident in.

743
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:41,089
So if I come back to
this, the way I can use

744
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:43,769
those powers is I
can say switch users

745
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,549
And do this one command.

746
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:47,469
So I can say pseudo, and
then it would do it and

747
00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:49,830
it won't complain about
about the permission stuff.

748
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,150
So you can be using
pseudo freal.

749
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,829
You all have pseudo axis.

750
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:55,169
Sometimes when you
do something this,

751
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:56,270
it'll put up a prop,

752
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,050
that says, Oh, this is
like so many megabytes.

753
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,970
Are you sure you want to
install it? Do you have space?

754
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,510
And if you're automating things,

755
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,850
which you all will be doing,

756
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,490
you don't want to be
propped at anything,

757
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,689
is it just like you
want to hit like

758
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:07,010
go and everything should happen.

759
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,249
And so that's why I might
say d y here, right?

760
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:12,369
So Apt can have a
dash that means, say,

761
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:13,649
like, yes to
everything, just get

762
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:15,749
it installed, get
it done, right?

763
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:21,390
Alright. Cool. So
That's all good.

764
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,729
Let's get like a real file
with some actual stuff in it.

765
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:27,009
So if I come back to
these lecture snippets

766
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:28,930
that you can again
find from the website,

767
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,129
or you could use this tiny URL.

768
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:34,050
I have a little dataset here
that I'm just going to grab

769
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,909
and use as an example.
Somebody come over here.

770
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:38,750
I'm going to download
it using W GT,

771
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,470
so we'll get something
from the web.

772
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,749
And again, like, your notes now

773
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:44,269
should have a bunch of
commands in them, right?

774
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:49,050
You should have W
G, SSH, LS, PWD.

775
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,789
All these different things
we've been learning, right?

776
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:54,430
So I'm going to do that, I'm
going to download that file.

777
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,270
If I do LS, I can see now
I have that right here.

778
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,769
If I wanted to, I can move it.

779
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:04,729
I could say move, and then
I could say that and I

780
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:07,869
could say like some
directory I wanted to go to.

781
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:09,890
I could also give it a new name.

782
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,470
So Move is also for renaming.

783
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,969
So this is the old name. This is

784
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:15,469
the new name. I'm
going to do that.

785
00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:18,010
LS. I can see that this is gone,

786
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,310
and I have stations instead.

787
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,589
CP is for copy, right?

788
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:23,929
So I could copy stations,

789
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:26,150
and maybe I call
that backup dot TXT.

790
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,769
Those are commands
you're going to be using

791
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:30,075
all the time to just
move stuff around.

792
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,040
Sometimes I might want to copy

793
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,160
something not on
the same machine,

794
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,180
but I might want to copy
it to a different machine.

795
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,439
Maybe I want to copy
my homework off of

796
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:40,680
my virtual machine onto my
laptop for backup purposes.

797
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,380
I'm exit out of the
shell right now.

798
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,999
And maybe, what is a
shortcut to get out

799
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:48,899
of here? Right here.

800
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:51,380
Control D, excellent.
I'm out of here now.

801
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,399
And this is going to be
a combination of SSH,

802
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,919
which we've seen and CP,

803
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,280
and the final thing
is just called SCP.

804
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,199
I'm actually trying
to go back to

805
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:02,660
that SH command. I'll do SCP.

806
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,019
And what I can do is I
can say colon after that,

807
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:07,925
I can say my VM file.

808
00:29:07,925 --> 00:29:10,069
Space, and then
I'll say, where I

809
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:12,069
want it to go on
my laptop, right?

810
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:13,590
What file do I want there.

811
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:18,049
And so on over here on
my virtual machine,

812
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:19,990
it was called stations dot TXT.

813
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,689
And I have to say what
directory it's in,

814
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:23,569
and I was just trying like
in my home directory.

815
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:24,949
That's where I land by default.

816
00:29:24,949 --> 00:29:28,949
And Tilda is basically a
shortcut from my home directory.

817
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:30,609
So I can copy that, and I

818
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:32,609
can tell whatever I
want over here, right?

819
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:36,310
So I can maybe call this
my Stations dot TXT,

820
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,349
that will download it from my

821
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:40,069
virtual machine onto my laptop,

822
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,629
and then I can open
up my stations,

823
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:44,530
dot TXT if I wanted
and use it there.

824
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:48,649
All right. So let me pop back
into my virtual machine.

825
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:52,069
So I could download it and I
could view my data that way.

826
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:54,229
Another thing I can do is I
can actually view it on here.

827
00:29:54,229 --> 00:29:55,770
A lot of these
commands are named.

828
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,110
Again, you just have to memorize

829
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,130
a bunch of stuff here at the
beginning of the semester.

830
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,850
So CAT is a way to see
what's inside of a file.

831
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,509
So I can say CAT stations at

832
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,549
TXT and try to dump
what all is there.

833
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:07,310
That kind of took a
while and if we're

834
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,310
actually dealing with
like a serious data set,

835
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,689
it will take even longer.

836
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:12,089
So some other commands people

837
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:14,190
typically use are head and tail.

838
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,789
T's just the beginning
or just the end, right?

839
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:18,530
So I could say head of stations.

840
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,830
By the way, when I'm typing

841
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,029
this, like, don't
type the whole thing.

842
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,770
L type a couple of
letters and hit tab.

843
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,229
That's going to save
you a lot of time.

844
00:30:24,229 --> 00:30:26,110
I could do head of stations,

845
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,549
or I could do tail of
stations if I wanted to,

846
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:30,829
and I could get either like

847
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,294
the last ten or the first ten.

848
00:30:33,294 --> 00:30:34,879
Right? So you should
be kind of like

849
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:36,479
noting down like what
these commands are.

850
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:38,439
And I also want you
to be able to go and

851
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:41,079
learn more details about
how these commands work.

852
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,439
Now these commands might be

853
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:43,599
on different versions of Linux,

854
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:45,539
they might be on Mac,
maybe it's on Windows.

855
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:46,619
I don't know. And so one of

856
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:47,899
the challenges is
when you Google it,

857
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:49,180
sometimes you'll see directions

858
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,740
for it that don't
apply to your system.

859
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,579
And so it's actually really
useful to be to look up

860
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:54,879
directions directly on the
system you're working on.

861
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:56,640
And so one of the ways I
could do that is I could

862
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,259
say tail dash Hell, right?

863
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,079
This is an example of
a flag that a lot of

864
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,139
commands have that can

865
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:03,419
give me some more
directions, right?

866
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:05,204
And I can tell me
more how to use this.

867
00:31:05,204 --> 00:31:08,010
And so maybe instead
of getting ten lines,

868
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,730
maybe I only wanted
like three lines.

869
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,749
And so can anybody just kind
of read through this and see

870
00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:16,469
any flags I can use to just
output the last three lines?

871
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:19,410
Yeah, right here. Dash
in. That was fast.

872
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,869
Excellent, right?
I can do dashN,

873
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:22,129
and I can say three
lines, right?

874
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:26,609
So I can say tail the
stations and dash in three,

875
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:28,849
and I would get three
lines or I can do

876
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:31,809
five lines or however many
I want to have, right?

877
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:33,029
So get d red at kind

878
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:34,309
of looking up
documentation like that.

879
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,730
It's going to be
faster than Googling,

880
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,789
and it's going to
be more accurate

881
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:38,679
because it's actually
on your system.

882
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:41,489
Another one that I
want you to know.

883
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:44,870
So N F is maybe super
useful a semester.

884
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,730
This is called Tail
with following.

885
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,249
So, like I said, right,

886
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:50,129
you might be running a
bunch of different programs

887
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:51,349
and it doesn't
make sense to have

888
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:52,710
all the output coming
to the screen.

889
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,369
You may be redirecting that
output to the various files,

890
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:56,569
but you might want to watch for

891
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:58,629
a particular process
like what the output is.

892
00:31:58,629 --> 00:32:00,339
And so you could look at

893
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:02,550
Tail of a log file.

894
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,690
But maybe that log file
is constantly growing.

895
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,589
If I do a dash F on
it, it'll follow it.

896
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:07,429
And you can see, like,

897
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:08,909
it's still running
right now, right?

898
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:10,830
So if there's more stations

899
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,130
that are appended to this file,

900
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,390
it'll just keep showing
those as they keep coming,

901
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,929
right? So it they'll
run forever.

902
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:18,229
And it's nobody's writing
to the file right now,

903
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:19,450
so it's not very interesting,

904
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,889
but I can follow that file
if If I want to kill it,

905
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:24,669
I have to do Control
C. Control C

906
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:27,699
kills whatever it is
I'm trying to do.

907
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:29,930
Oh, right. Cool.

908
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:33,169
So that was files. Any
file questions so far?

909
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:38,250
Fantastic. So files live
inside of directories.

910
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,070
And so let's learn a little
bit about directories.

911
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,530
Maybe I'll make a directory.

912
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,950
So MK for M and
DIR for directory,

913
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,909
and I'm going to make
one called Data.

914
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:48,189
So I do that, and if I do

915
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:49,789
LS, I can see all of these here.

916
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:51,069
Maybe I kind of have a hint that

917
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,730
it's a directory
based on the color,

918
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:57,159
but it's not really telling
me all I need to know. Right?

919
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:59,499
Like it's not necessarily
obviously, it's a directory.

920
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,579
I need to get more
information out of LS.

921
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,340
Let's learn a little
bit more about LS.

922
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,960
I could do LS help,
like we did before.

923
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,819
Another thing I could do
is I could say, Man, LS.

924
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,299
Man stands for manual,

925
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:12,260
and your Linux distribution

926
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,259
comes with a manual.
Isn't that fantastic?

927
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,760
So I could look up in the
manual and see what LS does,

928
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,520
and I can kind of
stroll through here.

929
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,560
And it actually has quite a lot.

930
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,130
You could spend a lot of kind

931
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,170
of time reading through this
and getting proficient.

932
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,649
But I can see that L will give
me a long listing format.

933
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:31,269
So let's see what happens
when I go back to LS,

934
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:34,890
I do L. Now I see instead of
putting these horizontally,

935
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,309
it puts them vertically,

936
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:37,529
and there's a whole bunch of

937
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:39,729
other information
that trues with it.

938
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:41,329
One of the things
that trues with

939
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:43,529
it are these permission strings,

940
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:44,690
and those kind of permissions

941
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,470
tell you what you can
do with a resource.

942
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,029
And we're going
to be looking and

943
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:49,369
learning what all
of these things do.

944
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:50,909
But the very first
character tells you

945
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:52,789
whether it's a directory
or a file, right?

946
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:55,109
So data is a directory,
so I have a D here.

947
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:57,189
These other ones where it's
a dash are not a directory,

948
00:33:57,189 --> 00:33:59,830
so that is kind of implying
they're a file in that case.

949
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,485
I can kind of go through and
read what's going on there.

950
00:34:03,485 --> 00:34:05,779
Other flags are useful are H.

951
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:07,459
So this column right here is

952
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:09,559
telling me how many
bytes there are.

953
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,119
And that's a little
bit hard to read.

954
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,320
It's kind of a large number.

955
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,039
If I say H, that means do like

956
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,019
a human readable
format, and I say, Oh,

957
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:17,439
this one is 11 megabytes,

958
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:20,099
or this one's 4 kilobytes.
I can see it like that.

959
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,059
These are flags, and it
depends on the tool,

960
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:24,379
but a lot of flags, the
order doesn't matter, right?

961
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:26,519
So LH, HL, doesn't matter.

962
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:28,720
I can get the same output.

963
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,659
Another flag for this,

964
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,139
that is very important is A.

965
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:35,019
A means, show me
everything, right?

966
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:36,580
I do A and there's
a bunch more stuff.

967
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,340
The stuff that I got
now that was missing,

968
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,619
where all these files here.

969
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,160
They all start with a period.

970
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,200
Files and directories
that start with a period,

971
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,180
and Linux are what
we call hidden.

972
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,520
They aren't shown by default.

973
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,779
If I want to see everything,
including the hidden stuff,

974
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:51,799
I'm going to run that
to see what is there.

975
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,559
What happens if I go inside of

976
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:56,199
the stata directory and I
run that command again.

977
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,719
I actually see that
even though I didn't

978
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,440
put anything inside of
the stata directory,

979
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,999
there are two things
that are already here,

980
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,839
and I almost don't even
really think of these as

981
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,000
real things that are existing,

982
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,699
even though they are, because

983
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:08,939
I almost think of them
as like aliases, right?

984
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:10,700
So the dot is like an alias

985
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,699
for the directory I'm
currently in, right?

986
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:13,999
So if I do LS dot,

987
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,680
that's the same as just LS.

988
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,780
And dot dot means one directory,

989
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,279
right? So let me just see.

990
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:20,739
This is the directory
I'm in now,

991
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:25,399
cd dot dot, This is the directory
I'm in now, cd dot dot.

992
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:27,499
This is the directory
I'm in now.

993
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:29,159
You actually see
that that dot dot

994
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,499
was a relative path, right?

995
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:31,819
If I say cd dot dot,

996
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:34,319
where it ends up really
depends on where I started.

997
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:36,140
It was relative to
where I started.

998
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,959
We can use relative paths or

999
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:39,659
absolute paths in
general, right?

1000
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:42,499
So I could do CD back to TRH.

1001
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:44,459
Actually, let me
just see this here.

1002
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,300
I could say CD back to TRH,

1003
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,480
which is my users directory,

1004
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,579
or I could say CD home TRH.

1005
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:54,020
So this one was a relative,

1006
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,359
I was relative to where I was.

1007
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,739
This one is an absolute.

1008
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:58,959
It tells me from the top
directory all the way down,

1009
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:01,339
where exactly am I going?

1010
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:03,720
You might see that under
this home directory,

1011
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,100
there's actually things
for a few different users.

1012
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,339
And I kind of actually did that.

1013
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:11,099
The common thing
is that a student

1014
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:12,259
will come to me panicked
and they'll be like,

1015
00:36:12,259 --> 00:36:14,300
Oh, I lost all my homework.

1016
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,420
And the most common reason
is they switch laptops

1017
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,339
or something like
that or somehow

1018
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,539
they end up with
a different user,

1019
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:20,959
and the new user doesn't
have any files, right?

1020
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,919
So that happens. Well, talk

1021
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,359
to me if you want,
but don't panic.

1022
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,159
L check here first.
There's probably under

1023
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,080
a different home
users directory.

1024
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,019
Yeah, question right here.

1025
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,629
Oh, that's an
excellent question.

1026
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:37,349
What's the difference between
this one and this one?

1027
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:39,169
So I'm an EMAC user,

1028
00:36:39,169 --> 00:36:41,829
and EMAC will automatically
create backups for me,

1029
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:44,549
and backups, it just
puts a tilt at then.

1030
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:45,929
So it's like an E MAC thing, and

1031
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:48,550
other programs might do
all kinds of backups.

1032
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,709
And I should actually delete

1033
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,909
those because I was
going to create those.

1034
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,749
Again, thank you for
pointing that out.

1035
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:56,970
That was from the
morning lecture.

1036
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,329
Yeah. Anyway, it's
just a backup,

1037
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:00,310
and you'll see that if
you're an Emax user.

1038
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,069
Yeah, Drew great question.
Other questions people have.

1039
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:04,689
Again, anybody should feel

1040
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,149
free to just pop up
a hand at any time.

1041
00:37:06,149 --> 00:37:08,030
I want to make sure
that everybody's

1042
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,590
following along and getting
their questions answered.

1043
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:16,849
All right. Fantastic. So
let me come back here.

1044
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:21,129
And what I want to do
now is I want to try

1045
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:22,989
creating a file here

1046
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:25,169
because we're going a learn
about some permission stuff,

1047
00:37:25,169 --> 00:37:27,310
and when I try to
create test at TXT,

1048
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,610
which I actually just deleted,

1049
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,330
it says, permission denied.

1050
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,670
I have permission to create
stuff in my home directory.

1051
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,509
I don't have permission
to create stuff here.

1052
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:36,969
So I could do, like,

1053
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:39,664
a pseudo if I wanted to,
and that would work.

1054
00:37:39,664 --> 00:37:41,859
Or what I could do is I

1055
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,079
could try to switch to
the root user in general.

1056
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,439
If I just say SU, that's to
switch to a different user.

1057
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:50,159
And so it's asking me, by
default, it goes to the root.

1058
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,699
It's asking me what is the
password for the root?

1059
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:52,859
I actually never set that, so

1060
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:54,479
there's no password
that's going to work.

1061
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,359
I'm going to do control
C. And so there's

1062
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:57,839
this weird pattern
you'll sometimes see

1063
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,639
it's pudo pseudo Su.

1064
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,659
So pseudo means do
one thing as root,

1065
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:04,119
and that one thing I'm going
to do is switch to the root.

1066
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:06,339
If I'm switching to
the root as root,

1067
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:07,739
I don't need to pass
word. So I do that.

1068
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:09,979
Now you actually see I'm
running as the root user,

1069
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:12,639
and now I can do whatever
I want as a root user.

1070
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:15,680
So I may say, Touch test at TXT.

1071
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,119
Then I have that file here.

1072
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,399
And then maybe
I'll just edit it.

1073
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,940
I'll say test at TXT,

1074
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,319
and I'll say hello
from root file.

1075
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:27,260
A fantastic.

1076
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,039
And if I want to, I can
see what's inside of

1077
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:31,759
it. All that works.

1078
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,939
If I do control D, I'm
may pop out of the root

1079
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:36,399
and back to my regular user.
I'm going to try this again.

1080
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,314
Can I see what's
inside of this file?

1081
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:40,329
And kind of surprisingly I can.

1082
00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:43,569
I can see the root users
data in some cases, right?

1083
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:45,590
So why is that? We have
to dig in and actually

1084
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,309
understand how Linux
file permissions work.

1085
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:51,290
And so I'm do is
I'm may do an LSL.

1086
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,550
I'm going to look at
this test dot TXT.

1087
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:56,189
And I'm to look at these
ten things over here.

1088
00:38:56,189 --> 00:38:58,070
There's always ten
characters at the beginning.

1089
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,409
We talked about the first one.

1090
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:01,389
That's whether it's a
directory or a file.

1091
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:03,309
And then there's nine here.

1092
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:04,969
And the nine comes
in groups of three.

1093
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:07,409
It's RW X, RW X,

1094
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:11,189
RW X, that stands for read
the file, write the file.

1095
00:39:11,189 --> 00:39:13,429
Execute the file. Execute means

1096
00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:14,769
it's like running
like a program.

1097
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,090
Some files are programs,

1098
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,875
So files are not programs.

1099
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:21,240
Okay? And so why do I have
to have it three times?

1100
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,199
Because it depends on who I am.

1101
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:27,979
The first three are for
the owner of the file.

1102
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:31,379
Whoever owns this file
can read it and write it,

1103
00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:32,959
but they cannot execute it.

1104
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:35,579
They do not have
permissions to execute it.

1105
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:38,699
Who owns the file? That's
this first column here.

1106
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:40,360
The root user owns

1107
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,834
the file and they can
read it or write it.

1108
00:39:42,834 --> 00:39:46,129
Okay. The next one is
for the group, right?

1109
00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:48,649
So the group for this file,

1110
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:50,569
anybody in that group can

1111
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:52,410
just read the file. That's
a little bit confusing.

1112
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:55,250
That's the second element
that there's a root group,

1113
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,749
which I'm in, and then
there's a root user,

1114
00:39:57,749 --> 00:39:59,629
which I am not, right?

1115
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:02,949
And so that person can read it.

1116
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:05,649
And then finally, this
last one stands for

1117
00:40:05,649 --> 00:40:09,369
other users who are not in
like any relevant group,

1118
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:10,789
and they can just read the file.

1119
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:12,369
And that means I'm another user,

1120
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,649
and so I can read
that file just fine.

1121
00:40:14,649 --> 00:40:17,109
Okay? So what if I
want to change this?

1122
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:20,149
What I could do is I
could use a CH mod.

1123
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:21,669
And CH Mod works like this.

1124
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,189
I say, who is it?

1125
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:26,269
And then what do I want
to change about them?

1126
00:40:26,269 --> 00:40:28,729
So, and then I finally have
to say what the file is.

1127
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:30,249
I'll say test TXT.

1128
00:40:30,249 --> 00:40:35,030
So who, I'm going to
say that's for others.

1129
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,689
And what am I interested in?

1130
00:40:36,689 --> 00:40:40,009
I'm interested in being
able to read the file.

1131
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:42,010
So I'm going to do that.
And that's not permitted.

1132
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,309
I'm going to do a pseudo on it.

1133
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:44,989
I'm going to do LS again.

1134
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:46,449
And that changed nothing, right?

1135
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,529
I mean, I said, let
other people read it.

1136
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,749
They already could. It doesn't

1137
00:40:49,749 --> 00:40:51,249
hurt to do it more
than one time.

1138
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,009
If I want to take it
away, then that means

1139
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:55,130
instead of doing plus,
I'll do a minus.

1140
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:58,194
So I'll say other users can
no longer read this file.

1141
00:40:58,194 --> 00:41:00,719
I'll do that. I see
that's been taken away.

1142
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,999
And so now as a normal user,

1143
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:04,359
If I try to look at it, I can

1144
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:06,899
have permission denied, right?

1145
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:11,040
If I go back to this and
I give it back to myself,

1146
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,119
then then I can
peek on it again,

1147
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,479
and I can see what's
in side of it.

1148
00:41:15,479 --> 00:41:17,099
Right? So you have to
change that. Most often,

1149
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,279
you'll be change
because you might

1150
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:19,639
be writing some little program,

1151
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,039
and you want to
make it executable,

1152
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,899
so I can run it like
a program. Right?

1153
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:24,859
Even if I'm the root user,

1154
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:26,679
I will get permission denied.

1155
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:31,899
You kind of think the
root Why did it do that?

1156
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:38,309
I'm There we go.

1157
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:39,969
I'll get a permission
tonight if I try to run it,

1158
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:41,169
eventhough I'm the
rode user, well,

1159
00:41:41,169 --> 00:41:42,470
if I don't haven't given myself

1160
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,429
executable permissions,
I can't run it.

1161
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:45,950
I can give myself
those permissions,

1162
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,390
but that doesn't mean
I can do it unless

1163
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,370
I choose to give myself
those permissions.

1164
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:57,430
Oh, right. Any questions
about Linux permissions?

1165
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:05,039
Yeah, over here. Yeah. How
would I change the group?

1166
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,879
That's a good question.
Is it like change group?

1167
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:10,139
I don't know. It's
not something I do

1168
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:11,519
often. I'd have to look at it.

1169
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,339
I wonder if this would change
the group for that file.

1170
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:18,620
Change the group of that staff.

1171
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:24,340
I wonder if I could change
try change the group of test.

1172
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,779
Like I have a docker group

1173
00:42:25,779 --> 00:42:27,939
on here. I wonder
if that would work.

1174
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,100
Maybe I have to just switch.

1175
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,219
Alright. So there we can do it.

1176
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:39,139
So it's just CH GRP.

1177
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:42,319
Yep. Yeah. Thanks for asking
and I learned myself, too.

1178
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,679
Yeah, other questions people

1179
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:46,199
have. The little
shortcut I did there.

1180
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,999
I typed CH. I hit
like Tab tab tab,

1181
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,239
and then it showed me the
commands that start with that.

1182
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,619
I thought, Oh, say,
change Mod, change group.

1183
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,719
All these things are related,
and you can just learn

1184
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:55,879
by poking around in

1185
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:57,939
that way and seeing what
is available to you.

1186
00:42:57,939 --> 00:43:01,079
Alright. Cool. So what
I want to do now is see

1187
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,939
how we can actually write a
program and deploy it, right?

1188
00:43:03,939 --> 00:43:05,079
So I want to be, run it.

1189
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:06,999
I need to make sure all
the permissions are right.

1190
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:10,044
I wanted to work regardless
of what directory I'm in.

1191
00:43:10,044 --> 00:43:12,669
And so I'm going to
pop out of here.

1192
00:43:12,669 --> 00:43:14,750
I'm going to go back
to my home directory.

1193
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,289
And what I want to do
is I want to be able to

1194
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:19,849
run as a Python three program.

1195
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:21,469
Right? I'm may look
at Python three.

1196
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:23,229
I can run stuff in there.

1197
00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:24,829
I can say control
D when I'm done.

1198
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:27,629
I want to make a simple
little Python three program.

1199
00:43:27,629 --> 00:43:31,150
And what I'm trying to
do is it is tra to count

1200
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,129
how many stations there are

1201
00:43:33,129 --> 00:43:36,229
in my stations file over here.

1202
00:43:36,229 --> 00:43:40,170
Oh, I'm going to move all
my TXT stuff to that data.

1203
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,869
All right? So let me
just say look at data,

1204
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:45,370
and then stations at TXT.

1205
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,649
I want to write a
little program that's

1206
00:43:47,649 --> 00:43:48,849
sin count how many
things are there.

1207
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:49,829
I'm going to show you how we can

1208
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:51,129
then deploy this program.

1209
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:51,549
All right.

1210
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:54,209
So I'm going to make a new
program called count dot pi.

1211
00:43:54,209 --> 00:43:57,729
And what I'll do is I'll
say the count equals zero,

1212
00:43:57,729 --> 00:43:59,569
and then I want to loop
over all the lines in

1213
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:01,749
that file. So I will open it.

1214
00:44:01,749 --> 00:44:06,695
I'll say with open
data stations dot txt.

1215
00:44:06,695 --> 00:44:08,819
I'll open that as F,

1216
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:12,199
and then I can just loop over
it for line and F. I can

1217
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:16,059
just say count plus equals
one, and then what?

1218
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:18,579
Then I can just print
off what that count is.

1219
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:22,799
Just have a simple
little Python program.

1220
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:25,359
And let me just exit out of
here and see what it does.

1221
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,759
So if I want to, I can say
Python three count Pi,

1222
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:29,879
and it runs, and it counts

1223
00:44:29,879 --> 00:44:33,179
how many lines are in that
station's file, right?

1224
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:35,299
So what I want to do is
I want to be able to run

1225
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:38,560
this count Pi program like
anywhere on my system,

1226
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,300
and I don't want to
have to say Python

1227
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,299
three in front of it. All right.

1228
00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:44,659
So let's try that. So first,

1229
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:47,359
I'm going to try to say
count dot Pi like that,

1230
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,639
and it's saying that
it's not found.

1231
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:51,919
Where I come back to
that. Help it find

1232
00:44:51,919 --> 00:44:54,240
M say very explicitly,
it's in this directory.

1233
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,859
So now I know you can find it,

1234
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,319
and I can say count dot Pi.

1235
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,220
Now it's saying
permission denied.

1236
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,679
I don't have permission
to run that.

1237
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:04,679
Why do I not have permission
to run it? Let me check.

1238
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:07,519
M say LL, and I can see,

1239
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:10,159
a, nobody has permissions on it.

1240
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:12,999
Nobody can execute
that file, right?

1241
00:45:12,999 --> 00:45:15,419
So let me make it executable.

1242
00:45:15,419 --> 00:45:18,039
So I'm going to say CH Mod,

1243
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:20,879
and then I'm going to say

1244
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:25,429
something and then
I'm may say count Pi.

1245
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:27,929
Any thoughts on what I might

1246
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:29,889
put here to make it executable.

1247
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:32,850
Maybe for my user or for
anybody, you can decide.

1248
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:39,169
Yeah, go ahead. Let's try
plus x. I'm going I do that.

1249
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:42,529
There we go. Now other
users can execute this.

1250
00:45:42,529 --> 00:45:44,809
Let's try executing it.

1251
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,689
And what do we get?

1252
00:45:47,689 --> 00:45:49,249
I guess before we got something

1253
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:51,289
about permission denied
when we tried to do it,

1254
00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:52,690
it's always good to
pay close attention

1255
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,029
to those errors because
if you try stuff,

1256
00:45:54,029 --> 00:45:55,210
sometimes you're
making progress,

1257
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,489
but you're getting
a different error.

1258
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:59,149
Different error is often
progress. I may run this.

1259
00:45:59,149 --> 00:46:02,610
And well, that's
kind of interesting.

1260
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,509
I wonder if it's like
looking at the owner for it.

1261
00:46:04,509 --> 00:46:08,179
Let me try The CH mod again.

1262
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:10,360
I'm going to say
A for everybody.

1263
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,479
I can do it. And then let me
take a look at that again.

1264
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,619
I actually thought that
was during to work.

1265
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,440
I was a little
surprised that doesn't.

1266
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,660
Maybe it's just like only
looks at for me particularly

1267
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,319
instead of checking for others
first. And I can do that.

1268
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,019
And now I actually get
a different error.

1269
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:24,499
It's not permission denied,
but it's like, Well,

1270
00:46:24,499 --> 00:46:25,919
I can run this thing,
but I don't even know

1271
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:27,679
what to expect in
there. What's going on?

1272
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:29,680
Now? Well, Linux doesn't

1273
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,560
know what kind of file
this is. Is it Python?

1274
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,779
Is it PHP? Is it
Java? What is it?

1275
00:46:33,779 --> 00:46:36,949
And so it's assuming that
it's a shell stripped, okay?

1276
00:46:36,949 --> 00:46:39,739
That's my problem. And so
I need to tell it this

1277
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:43,079
is a Python program
specifically, right?

1278
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:45,759
Not just some other
kind of random program.

1279
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,520
I have to run this
program with Python

1280
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,179
like this with the Python three.

1281
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,919
And what I have to
do is I figure out

1282
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:55,899
where is Python three.

1283
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:57,199
So this which command is super

1284
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:58,299
useful in your deploying suf

1285
00:46:58,299 --> 00:47:00,960
because it shows you where
it's installed on your system.

1286
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,459
And so Python three on

1287
00:47:02,459 --> 00:47:05,619
my system is at this
location right here.

1288
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:08,129
I'm going to grab that. And I'm

1289
00:47:08,129 --> 00:47:10,489
going to come back
to count of Pi,

1290
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:11,809
and I'm going to
put something at

1291
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:13,349
the top called a Shabang line.

1292
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:14,949
And the Shabang
line it starts like

1293
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:16,949
a comment explanation
mark, and then I say,

1294
00:47:16,949 --> 00:47:18,729
this is the program
that should be

1295
00:47:18,729 --> 00:47:21,009
used to run the
following program.

1296
00:47:21,009 --> 00:47:26,539
Right? I'm going to
do this. All right.

1297
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:29,539
And now I ought to be
able to say count dot Pi,

1298
00:47:29,539 --> 00:47:32,559
and it works just fine, right?

1299
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,640
I can run it like that without

1300
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,899
saying Python in front of it.

1301
00:47:35,899 --> 00:47:37,439
It's executable, and it

1302
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:40,039
antains information internally
about how to run it.

1303
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:41,679
Now, if I really
wanted to deploy this,

1304
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:43,499
I'd probably want to be able
to run this anywhere, right?

1305
00:47:43,499 --> 00:47:45,440
So if I go to like a
different directory,

1306
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,279
like I should be able do
count Pi anywhere, right?

1307
00:47:49,279 --> 00:47:51,539
And so I have to figure
out how to install it.

1308
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:53,219
And how do I install it?

1309
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:56,510
Well, If I run
something like LS,

1310
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:01,270
that works fine, and LS is
a program in this location.

1311
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,669
So there's certain locations on

1312
00:48:02,669 --> 00:48:05,430
my computer where it
will look for programs.

1313
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,209
And if it's not one of
those, then I have to do

1314
00:48:07,209 --> 00:48:09,509
the dot slash and tell
it exactly where it is.

1315
00:48:09,509 --> 00:48:12,189
And what I want to do is I
want to move my program to one

1316
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:14,750
of these special
directories where it looks.

1317
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,590
And that's defined
by something called

1318
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,909
a path variable.
So I do echo path.

1319
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:21,850
And this is actually a whole
bunch of different paths,

1320
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,350
and they're separated by colons.

1321
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,489
This is a place that look, this

1322
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:28,909
is a place that'll look,
so on and so forth.

1323
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:34,589
Maybe what I'll do is I'll
move Pi, into one of these.

1324
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:37,109
Maybe I'll choose
this one right here.

1325
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,329
And let's try that.

1326
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:41,789
And I don't have
permission to put it there

1327
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:43,350
because I'm really kind of
installing it for everybody.

1328
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:44,869
I'll do a pseudo for it.

1329
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:48,209
And now I can just say Tount
top Pi, and it will run it.

1330
00:48:48,209 --> 00:48:50,230
If it's not here anymore.

1331
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,569
So if I say which on it,

1332
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:53,609
if I say which on Count top Pi,

1333
00:48:53,609 --> 00:48:55,629
and I can see there it
is. These little tools.

1334
00:48:55,629 --> 00:48:57,069
I kind of like
looking at the path,

1335
00:48:57,069 --> 00:48:58,715
running the which command.

1336
00:48:58,715 --> 00:49:01,559
Change the permissions on
stuff, adding a haban line.

1337
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:03,700
All those things are going
to help you install stuff

1338
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,800
somewhere and make it
generally available.

1339
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,199
You know, if I come up
here, I can do it, too.

1340
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:11,959
It'll crash because I
don't have my local file,

1341
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:13,179
which is maybe not a big deal.

1342
00:49:13,179 --> 00:49:15,919
I could fix that other ways,
but I could have it there.

1343
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:19,339
On Linux, file extensions
are just for the human.

1344
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:20,499
They just are kind of a way of

1345
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,919
telling you what
is probably there,

1346
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,479
but it doesn't actually
have any meaning to it.

1347
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,259
So if I want to, I can move

1348
00:49:26,259 --> 00:49:30,999
this user local
Ben count dot Pi.

1349
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:33,279
And I could call this

1350
00:49:33,279 --> 00:49:36,179
like something like Count
demo, if I wanted to.

1351
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:38,979
Oh. And like I said, I
have to have pseudo on it.

1352
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:40,939
And now I just have this
count demo program.

1353
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:42,059
And the way it figures out its

1354
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:43,399
Python is by that a bang line.

1355
00:49:43,399 --> 00:49:45,859
Linux doesn't care the
extension, only I care.

1356
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:48,359
So I was able to take my program
and basically deploy it.

1357
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:49,899
It's a generally
runable thing that

1358
00:49:49,899 --> 00:49:52,020
anybody can use now
